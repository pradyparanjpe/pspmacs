* Inheritance
- Only for this file, the inheritance is overridden.
  - If =local-emacs-directory/modules/load-order.yml= exists, it is loaded.
    ELSE, if =pvt-emacs-directory/modules/load-order.yml= exists, it is loaded.
    ELSE, =user-emacs-directory/modules/load-order.yml= is loaded.

* Modules-order
- Yaml association lists of modules in order
  - Lists are sorted by keys before loading the modules. Thus, a list identified by key =0= is loaded before that identified by key =1=.
  - If one intend to extend the set of loaded modules, one should create a new list with additional modules.
  - If one intends to replace a set of loaded modules, one should redefine a list identified by that key.
    - To silence loading a list, it may be redefined as an empty list.
