;;; Commentary:

;; Code similar to following should be placed in ~/.config/chemacs/profiles.el

;;; Code:

(("pspmacs" . ((user-emacs-directory . "~/.local/share/pspmacs")
           (env . (("PVT_EMACS_HOME" . "~/.local/share/private/pspmacs")
               ("LOCAL_EMACS_HOME" . "~/.local/share/private/pspmacs/local.d"))))))

;;; profiles.el ends here
